Pancit canton is a famous snack or an occasion food in the Philippines. It is a stir fry noodles made in wheat-flour egg noodles.

And for a long time, pansit evolved and has been adopted by the Filipinos, and today, pancit has a different variation, and pansit canton is one of them.

<h1> Procedure </h1>
<ol>
<li> <p> Make the sauce. Mix together all the ingredients, pour in a small pan and cook until thickened and no longer cloudy. Simmer (to remove all traces of starchy taste) while stir frying. </p></li>
<li> <p> In a wok or frying pan, heat the cooking oil. Add the beans, onion, carrot and cabbage, one after the other, with an interval of about 10 seconds and stirring between each addition. Add the meat or seafood. Stir. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper — do this sparingly as you will be adding a well-seasoned sauce later. </p></li>
<li> <p> Add the noodles. Pour in about a cup of hot (simmering would be best) broth over the noodles which should make it start softening instantly. Cook, stirring often, just until the noodles are done. The vegetables will cook at about the same time. Pour the simmering sauce over the cooked noodle dish. Stir. Cook for another minute. </p></li>
<li> <p> Serve at once.</p></li>
