<h1> Procedure </h1>
<ol>
<li> <p>In a large bowl combine both types of glutinous rice, add enough water to fully soak them and leave in a cool place for 24 hours.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Fully drain your rice then place them in a food processor or a blender, pulse to have a grainy wet consistency and add a bit of water while grinding them. You need to achieve a gritty but fine consistency similar to a moist sand.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Place the mixture in a lightly greased shallow tray, it should be no more than 2 cm in thickness.  Do not press or compact, it should be loose otherwise it will come out really hard, place in a steamer then steam for 20 minutes in really high heat or until cooked and tender.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Remove the cooked puto bumbong from the tray, slice and shape into small cylinders, place on a banana leaf lined plate then spread some margarine on top, generously sprinkle it with freshly grated coconut and some palm sugar granules then serve.</p> </li>
