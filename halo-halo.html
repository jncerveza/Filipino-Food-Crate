<h1> History </h1>
<p class="info">
Halo-halo is one of the most popular desserts of Filipinos, especially during summer. It consists of shaved ice, condensed milk, and lots of sweet toppings like jellies, beans, corn, candied fruit, fresh fruit, ube ice cream, and even sometimes pieces of leche flan (Filipino sweet custard). Halo-halo originated from the Japanese kakigōri class of desserts and pre-war Japanese Filipinos. Halo halo was formerly locally known as monggo con hielo and mongo-ya, this is the reason is, it only consisted of mung beans or in tagalog monggo. It's boiled and cooked in a syrup also served on top of crushed ice with milk and sugar. Over time, more native ingredients were added, resulting in the creation and development of the modern halo-halo. The difference between its  Japanese ancestor is the ingredients are mostly under the ice instead of putting on the top of it. The Commission on the Filipino Language considered the spelling of "halo-halo" to be incorrect because it is pronounced as “halu-halo”. Halo-halo is an adjective meaning in english, it translates to “mixed” which is the verb equivalent of halo “or to mix”
