<h1> Procedure </h1>
<ol>
<li> <p>Cut butter into cubes and freeze for about 1 hour.  In a bowl, whisk together flour, sugar and salt and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li> <p>Add butter to flour mixture. Cut the butter into the flour using a pastry blender or by pinching the fat into the flour mixture with hands. Work them together until resembling coarse cornmeal with pea-like, butter-speckled pieces.</p></li>
<li> <p>Slowly drizzle water to flour-butter mixture and with hands, mix until just combined. If the dough is too crumbly and does not hold together, add more water a tablespoon at a time.  DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH LIQUID and DO NOT OVERWORK DOUGH.</p></li>
<li> <p>Gently gather dough into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. </p></li>
<li> <p>Meanwhile, in a wide pan over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened. </p></li>
<li> <p>Add ground beef and cook, breaking into pieces with the back of the spoon, for about 6 to 8 minutes, or until no longer pink.</p></li>
<li> <p>Add tomato sauce and water and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer until meat is cooked.</p></li>
<li> <p>Add potatoes and carrots and cook until tender. </p></li>
<li> <p>Add green peas and raisins. Continue to cook until vegetables are heated through and liquid is reduced. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </p></li>
<li> <p>In a colander, drain meat filling and allow to cool completely.</p></li>
<li> <p>Divide pie crust into 12 balls. Place each ball between two sheets of parchment paper and with a rolling pin, gently flatten each ball into 5-inch diameter and 1/4-inch thickness.</p></li>
<li> <p>Using a round biscuit cutter or an inverted bowl, cut into the dough by gently twisting to form circles with smooth edges. Trim any excess dough.</p></li>
<li> <p>On a flat work surface, lay dough circle and spoon about a heaping tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the bottom of the dough over filling and with fingers, press edges firmly. Using tines of a fork, press on sides of dough to firmly seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. </p></li>
<li> <p>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, milk and salt.</p></li>
<li> <p>On a lightly greased baking sheet, arrange prepared empanadas in a single layer and brush top with egg wash. Bake in a 375 F oven for about 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned. </p></li>
<li> <p>Remove from oven and allow to slightly cool for about 1 to 2 minutes before removing from the baking sheet.
</p></li>
