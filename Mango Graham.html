    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      Mango Graham or Mango Float is a Filipino icebox cake with layers of graham crackers and between those layers is spreaded whipped cream or condensed milk and carabao mangoes . Mango Float is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino crema de fruta cake. There is also a different type of this dessert, its called Crema de mangga.  This dessert uses Crema de mangga custard and gulaman (agar) or gelatin, as in the original crema de fruta. Mango Graham is usually stored inside a refrigerator before being served, so that the layers will not slip off while eating it also to make the whipped cream slightly solid. </p>

<h1> Make One </h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
Hereâ€™s how to make some mango float (by Bebs of foxyfolksy.com)
<ul>
<li>8 leaves of pandan, cleansed well</li>
<li>5 buko which is no too hard and not to soft- grated in strips</li>
<li>10 cups of buko water (water from the 5 buko)</li>
<li>3 small cans of Nestle Cream</li>
<li>1 medium can of condensed milk</li>
<li>2 bars of green gulaman</li>
<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First, boil the buko water with eight pandan leaves that are individually twisted.  This is to break the fibers and expose the juice.</li>
  <li>Let it simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove the pandan leaves and make sure that the remaining coconut water is eight cups before adding the two bars of gulaman. This is because one bar of gulaman needs four cups of water.  So if it is more than eight cups, the gulaman will be mushy and soft, if the water is less, the gulaman will be hard.</li>
  <li>Dissolve the gulaman well by continuous stirring.</li>
  <li>Add sugar while mixing. Do this for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour through a strainer into cooling trays and wait till it hardens.</li>
  <li>Then put it in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Mix the grated buko with the 3 cans of cream and condensed milk.</li>
  <li>Get the gulaman in the fridge and cut into cubes. Mix with the buko mixture.</li>
</ul>
