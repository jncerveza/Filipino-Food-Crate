<h1> History </h1>
<p class="info">
Ice Candy is a block of ice that is flavored with syrup, it's usually covered in plastic to keep it hygienic and in shape when put inside the freezer. People speculate that ice candy was inspired by Americans, since Americans have popsicles or ice pops. But the difference is ice pops have a wooden stick at the bottom to give the consumer to hold the ice dessert. Ice candy is most of the time made out of mixed drinks like Milo or Nestle juice powder. We can usually find these things at our neighborhood or local “sari-sari” store (mini market). The flavors are also assorted and colorful, its easy to make. All you need to do is pick a desired juice or flavoring inside an ice block plastic, seal it and put it inside the freezer. Wait for 16-24 hours and wallah you already made an Ice Candy.
