<h1> History </h1>
<p class="info">
Sans Rival is a Filipino dessert cake made of layers of buttercream, meringue and chopped cashews. Its is rumored that Sans Rival originated from French dacquoise, a dessert cake that’s made from almonds, hassle nuts and whipped cream. Others say that the cake is descended from the tarta imperial rusa, the Spanish adaptation of a Russian cake that was popular with the Russian Imperial Family. Sans rival means "unrivaled” in French. Overtime filipinos came up with an idea to make a snack version of it and called it silvanas or sylvanas. It's a frozen cookie sandwich, coated in cashew crumbs, and made with two cashew-meringue wafers held together with a thick layer of buttercream.

<h1> Procedure </h1>
<ol>
<li> <p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 4 - 8x12 inch pans with parchment paper.</p> </li>
<li> <p>In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Sprinkle with cream of tartar. Gradually add 2 cups white sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in 2 cups chopped nuts. Divide meringue between the 4 pans, and spread evenly to edges.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until light golden brown. Remove the meringue from the baking pans while still hot; allow to cool. When cool, trim edges so that all 4 meringue layers are uniformly shaped. Set aside.</p> </li>
<li> <p>To make buttercream filling: In a large bowl, Beat butter until light and fluffy. In a separate large bowl, whip egg yolks until thick and lemon colored.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, and heat to 270 to 290 degrees F (132 to 143 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard but pliable threads. Add the hot syrup in a thin stream to the beaten egg yolks, while beating at high speed. Beat in the whipped butter until smooth. Beat in rum.</p> </li>
