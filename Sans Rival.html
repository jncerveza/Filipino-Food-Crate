    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Sans Rival is a Filipino dessert cake made of layers of buttercream, meringue and chopped cashews. Its is rumored that Sans Rival originated from French dacquoise, a dessert cake that’s made from almonds, hassle nuts and whipped cream. Others say that the cake is descended from the tarta imperial rusa, the Spanish adaptation of a Russian cake that was popular with the Russian Imperial Family. Sans rival means "unrivaled” in French. Overtime filipinos came up with an idea to make a snack version of it and called it silvanas or sylvanas. It's a frozen cookie sandwich, coated in cashew crumbs, and made with two cashew-meringue wafers held together with a thick layer of buttercream.</p>

<h1> Make One </h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 egg whites</li>
<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
<li>2 cups chopped cashews, toasted</li>
<li>1 pound butter, softened</li>
<li>12 egg yolks</li>
<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
<li>1 cup water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons dark rum</li>
<li>2 cups chopped cashews, toasted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 4 - 8x12 inch pans with parchment paper.</li>
  <li>In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Sprinkle with cream of tartar. Gradually add 2 cups white sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in 2 cups chopped nuts. Divide meringue between the 4 pans, and spread evenly to edges.</li>
  <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until light golden brown. Remove the meringue from the baking pans while still hot; allow to cool. When cool, trim edges so that all 4 meringue layers are uniformly shaped. Set aside.</li>
  <li>To make buttercream filling: In a large bowl, Beat butter until light and fluffy. In a separate large bowl, whip egg yolks until thick and lemon colored.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, and heat to 270 to 290 degrees F (132 to 143 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard but pliable threads. Add the hot syrup in a thin stream to the beaten egg yolks, while beating at high speed. Beat in the whipped butter until smooth. Beat in rum.</li>
  <li>On one layer of meringue, spread approximately 1/4 of the buttercream evenly to edges. Repeat layers until all is used. Smooth sides with spatula. Sprinkle top with 2 cups chopped cashews. Freeze until solid. To serve, cut 1 inch slices from the frozen dessert.</li>
</ul>
