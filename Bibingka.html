    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Bibingka is a type of baked rice cake, this term can also be used in rice cakes products, for example, those made with cassava flour. The Philippines share the origin of this cake from Indian, some authors have also proposed a connection between the Goan dessert bebinca (or bibik) and the Southeast Asian bibingka due to the similarity in names. The rice that bibingka is made of is usually fermented. Bibingka is cooked in a shallow terra cotta bowl lined with a single large section of a banana leaf. Bibingka is usually served during Sambang Gabi and Christmas, its can also be served during a special occasion.</p>

<h1> Make One </h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>/
<ul>
<li>1 cup rice flour</li>
<li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>½ cup sugar</li>
<li>¾ cup fresh milk</li>
<li>¼ cup water</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Toppings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>grated cheese</li>
    <li>grated coconut</li>
    <li>1 salted egg - cut into 8 to 12 thin slices</li>
    <li>butter - melted at room temperature for brushing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cut circles from the banana leaves for lining the pans. It should be double the size in diameter of the pans/molds or enough to cover the bottom and sides with a bit of excess as they tend to shrink when heated. Cut another batch of banana leaves for the top cover. Rinse and pat dry the banana leaves. Run each leaf quickly over the fire to make them limb and pliable.</li>
  <li>Line the pans/molds with banana leaves and brush them with butter. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Combine all the ingredients for the batter in a bowl and mix well with a spoon or whisk until mixture becomes smooth. The batter should normally be runny.</li>
  <li>Divide the mixture into the pans/molds. Be sure not to fill more than half of each pan/mold with the mixture as it will rise while baking. Add 2-3 slices of salted egg on each. Arrange them on the baking sheet and bake at 200°C/390°F in the middle rack for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li> Remove the sheet from the oven.</li>
  <li>Place prepared banana sheets brushed with butter on top of each pan/mold with the buttered part facing down. Put them back in the oven but this time on the top rack. If using a gas oven, turn on the top heat (grill/broil function).</li>
  <li> Bake for another 5 minutes or until nicely charred.Once done, remove from oven and brush each Bibingka with butter. Then top them with grated cheese and grated coconut.</li>
  <li>Serve while warm!</li>
</ul>
