    <h1>History</h1>
    <p class="info">One of the most popular and made dessert of the Philippines is Biko, biko is a delicious cake made of sticky rice, coconut milk, and sugar, usually topped with a caramelized coconut-milk-and-sugar reduction called latik. Some say that Biko originated from China. Biko can be widely found around the Philippines especially Cebu. In Northern Luzon biko is known as inikawar in Illocano and sinukmani or sinukmaneng in the Southern Luzon area. In Muslims they call it wadjit in Tausug and wagit in Maguindanao.</p>

    <li>2 cups canned coconut milk</li>

<h1>Procedure</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Generously grease an 8x8-inch square baking pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>In a large pot over medium heat, mix together the 1 cup coconut milk and 1cup water. Add the glutinous rice and pandan leaves. Bring to a simmer then turn heat to low and cover. Let it cook until all liquids are absorbed. The rice should only be almost cooked at this point.</li>
  <li>While waiting, prepare the latik syrup by combining the 2 cups coconut milk and 1 cup dark brown sugar on a large pan or pot. Cook over medium heat while constantly stirring until the liquid thickens into a camarel.</li>
  <li>Scoop and reserve ½ cup of the latik syrup for the topping later. Add the cooked rice without the pandan leaves to tha pan with the remaining latik syrup. Gently fold the sticky rice and the syrup until completely coated. Cook while stirring from time to time until the rice completely absorbs the syrup and the rice is fully cooked.</li>
  <li>Transfer the rice into the greased pan and spread out evenly. Pour the reserved latik syrup on spread evenly on top of the rice. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F/180°C for 20-30 minutes or until the latik is reduced and becomes bubbly.</li>
  <li>Remove from oven and let it cool down. Cut into squares and serve.</li>
